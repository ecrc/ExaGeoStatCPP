# @brief This script checks for Chameleon and includes it in the project if it is not already a target.

# Set basic configuration variables for the Chameleon library.
# 'name' is set to "CHAMELEON", which is the identifier used for the dependency throughout the script.
set(name "CHAMELEON")
# 'tag' specifies the version tag of the Chameleon library to fetch, indicating a specific state of the source code in the repository.
set(tag "v1.1.0")
# 'version' specifies the version of the Chameleon library. This may be used to ensure compatibility or meet specific requirements.
set(version "1.1.0")
# 'flag' can be used to pass additional flags to the configure/make commands when building the dependency. Flags here are for CUDA, BLAS vendor, MPI, StarPU, and disabling testing.

# 'is_cmake' is a boolean flag indicating whether the Chameleon library uses CMake for its build system. It's set to ON, meaning it does.
set(is_cmake ON)
# 'is_git' is a boolean flag indicating whether the Chameleon library's source code is hosted in a git repository. It's set to ON.
set(is_git ON)
# 'auto_gen' is a boolean flag indicating whether to use autogen scripts for the configuration process. It's set to OFF here.
set(auto_gen OFF)
# 'url' specifies the location of the Chameleon library's source code repository.
set(url "https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/chameleon.git")

# Include the 'ImportDependency' macro script located in the 'macros' directory.
# This macro is responsible for importing and possibly installing the dependency.
include(macros/ImportDependency)
# Call the 'ImportDependency' macro with the previously set configuration parameters.
# This macro checks if CHAMELEON is already available; if not, it proceeds to fetch, configure, build, and install it.
